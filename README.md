is your dog emo.
An app that pulls a random genre name string from the Genrenator API and a random dog image from the RandomDog API to answer life's great question: Is your dog emo? Maybe your dog is into Dominican Punk Chileno. Or Canadian R&B House. Let's find out! This app was inspired by isthisbandemo.com.

Original Pseudocode for app design (BIG PICTURE):
// Gather the bones: In my README, define all the elements that I need and their relationships to each other; which ones are just pretty to look at, which ones will interact with other elements, and how it’ll all come together.
// Put together the bones: First draft of my HTML, CSS, and JS code to put everything into my workspace.
// Make the skeleton come alive: Second draft of HTML, CSS, and JS code, focusing on JS logic and make the browser do what I want it to do.
// Make the skeleton spooky: Third and final draft of HTML, CSS, and JS code, focusing on CSS responsive design and overall simple, DRY coding.

Original Pseudocode for the app’s design (THE ACTUAL STEPS):
// Add the HTML button that'll activate both APIs; when I press this button, I want both APIs to pull data and return their results to the app.
// Add container element for the 'box' components to be appended to as children; I need two container elements, one for each API data result.
// Add cached element references for the container elements; create the JS code that will select these two boxes and allow us to play with them and make them do things.
// Add a cached element reference for the button; create the JS code that'll select the button and allow us to play with it and make it do things.
// Add an event listener to the button; I want to tell JS that when the user clicks on the button, something will happen.
// Write code for API call and examine response data (test with console.log); When both APIs are called, I want them to return a random value from the API (NOTE: This will likely take the most time to figure out how to apply select.random logic to the data I'm pulling.)
// Tweak event listeners so that the APIs are stored in a variable (test with console.log); Actually put those API calls into those boxes I defined earlier
// Create a test 'card' element with Bootstrap; start making this look nice and actually return the data I want and how I want it to look
// Add a function to handle appending a 'box' containing the API to the container element; I want to be able to restart the app with the button and return a new random value for each API.
// Style each box differently, based on what API is being pulled; get creative
// Once logic is sound and turns data I want, make app more visually appealing and creative; incorporate images, animations, sounds, etc
// Add confetti; for Ben!

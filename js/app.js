console.log('is your dog emo.');
/*---------------- Pseudo-Code -------------*/
// Add the HTML button that'll activate both APIs; when I press this button, I want both APIs to pull data and return their results to the app.
// Add container element for the 'box' components to be appended to as children; I need two container elements, one for each API data result.
// Add cached element references for the container elements; create the JS code that will select these two boxes and allows us to play with them and make them do things. (.getElementById, or querySelector/All.)
// Add a cached element reference for the button; create the JS code that'll select the button and allow us to play with it and make it do things. (.getElementById, or querySelector/All.)
// Add an event listener to the button; I want to tell JS that when the user clicks on the button, something will happen. (.addEventListener('click', ...))
// Write code for API call and examine response data (test with console.log); When both APIs are called, I want them to return a random value from the API (NOTE: This will likely take the most time to figure out how to apply select.random logic to the data I'm pulling.)
// Tweak event listeners so that the APIs are stored in a variable (test with console.log); Actually put those API calls into those boxes I defined earlier
// Create a test 'box' element with Bootstrap; start making this look nice and actually return the data I want and how I want it to look
// Add a function to handle appending a 'box' containing the API to the container element; I want to be able to restart the app with the button and return a new random value for each API.
// Put this all together through a fancy render function! (NOTE: This also will be my biggest challenge going into this, beside the random data logic.)
// Style each box differently, based on what API is being pulled; get creative
// Once logic is sound and turns data I want, make app more visually appealing and creative; incorporate images, animations, sounds, etc
// End my CSS design with at least one responsive media query; if needed
// Add confetti; for Ben :)



/*------------------- Project Outline -----------------------*/
                /* ROUND1: Gather The Bones */



                /* ROUND2: Create The Skeleton */



            /* ROUND3: Make The Skeleton Come Alive */



            /* ROUND4: Make The Skeleton Spooky */



/*----------- Transparency Report (Move to README) ----------*/



/*-------- Questions Upon Completion (Move to README) -------*/



/*---------------- Constants --------------------------------*/
/* OBJECTS THAT DON'T CHANGE AND WE'LL WANT TO REFER TO AND USE OFTEN */



/*---------------- Variables --------------------------------*/
/* OBJECTS THAT WE CAN REDIRECT AND MANIPULATE TO HELP US DO THINGS */



/*--------- Cached Element References -----------------------*/
/* Allows us to select and manipulate the DOM elements  */
/* document.getElementById('<element>') */
/* document.querySelector('<element>') */
/* document.querySelectorAll('<element>') */



/*------------- Event Listeners -----------------------------*/
/* Allows us to register an event listener for a given event; if we 'click' on something, something now happens */
/* <SELECT-DOM>.addEventListerner('<event-name>', <callback>); */



/*----------------- Functions -------------------------------*/
/* reuseable blocks of code performing one task; my verbs */



/*----------------- And Scene -------------------------------*/
/* and so it is

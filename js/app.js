/*------------------- Project Outline -----------------------*/
/* ROUND1: Gather The Bones */



/* ROUND2: Create The Skeleton */



/* ROUND3: Make The Skeleton Come Alive */



/* ROUND4: Make The Skeleton Spooky */



/*----------- Transparency Report ----------*/



/*-------- Questions Upon Completion -------*/



/*---------------- Constants --------------------------------*/
/* OBJECTS THAT DON'T CHANGE AND WE'LL WANT TO REFER TO AND USE OFTEN */
// Make my objects!



/*---------------- Variables --------------------------------*/
/* OBJECTS THAT WE CAN REDIRECT AND MANIPULATE TO HELP US DO THINGS */
// Make my variables!



/*--------- Cached Element References -----------------------*/
// Add cached element references for the container elements; create the JS code that will select these two boxes and allows us to play with them and make them do things. (.getElementById, or querySelector/All.)
// Add a cached element reference for the button; create the JS code that'll select the button and allow us to play with it and make it do things. (.getElementById, or querySelector/All.)



/*------------- Event Listeners -----------------------------*/
/* <SELECT-DOM>.addEventListerner('<event-name>', <callback>); */
// Add an event listener to the button; I want to tell JS that when the user clicks on the button, something will happen. (.addEventListener('click', ...))



/*----------------- Functions -------------------------------*/
/* reuseable blocks of code performing one task; my verbs */
// Write code for API call and examine response data (test with console.log); When both APIs are called, I want them to return a random value from the API (NOTE: This will likely take the most time to figure out how to apply select.random logic to the data I'm pulling.)
// Tweak event listeners so that the APIs are stored in a variable (test with console.log); Actually put those API calls into those boxes I defined earlier
// Add a function to handle appending a 'box' containing the API to the container element; I want to be able to restart the app with the button and return a new random value for each API.
// Put this all together through a fancy render function! (NOTE: This also will be my biggest challenge going into this, beside the random data logic.)
